# Classification_of_SDSS_Objects

Astronomy has been a casual interest of mine since I was young. I never seriously considered it a career, but I did end up minoring in astrophysics. So I was interested in doing a project related to astronomy in some way.

From Wikipedia:

"The Sloan Digital Sky Survey or SDSS is a major multi-spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey using a dedicated 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States. The project was named after the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which contributed significant funding."


The SDSS website has much of their data which can be queried using modified SQL commands. Using this data, I used various classification models to classify galaxies, stars, and quasars. I also used Plotly to display a 3D representation of those objects.
